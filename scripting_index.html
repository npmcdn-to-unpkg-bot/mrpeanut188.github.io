		Scripting: A simplified form of coding for in-game events. This is the introduction and getting started page for the tutorial series,

	<h3>Creating the script file</h2>
	<p>
		Scripts are contained inside of .GSC files. 
		
		To create a script, make a new .GSC file in your mod's maps folder. To edit an existing script, copy it from raw/maps to your mod's maps folder.
		Don't ever edit any files inside the raw directory unless you know what you are doing.
		
		Tick the checkmark next to the file in the mod tab of Launcher, which will include them in your IWD file when you build it.
	</p>
	
	<br/>
	
	<h3>Script Contents</h2>
	<p>
		Scripting is a lot like math. Math in real life is the reverse engineering of events and logic. <br/>
		If you have 5 bottles and 2 are taken away, you have 3. Math is, in a sense, the reverse engineering of reality.
		We can apply it's concepts to simulate events that can happen.
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		As your learning of math has been built upon many different concepts, so must your coding knowledge.
		To actually understand the best ways of applying scripting to real-life concepts, you ARE going to have to read a lot.
	</p>
	<p>
		For this first demonstration, we're going to do an idea generously donated by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">my guinea pig</span> RadimaX:
		<pre>An in-game trigger that gives you 250 points and has a cooldown of 5 rounds.</pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		To break this down, you have to think like a computer. You probably have heard computers work in 1's and 0's.
		So does logic: We can interpret this as true (1) and false (0), turning it into an if-then statement.
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		For example:
		<pre>IF player knifes a trigger AND it's been more than 5 rounds THEN give them 250 points.</pre>
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		This example will require some advanced techniques that are talked about more in-depth in their own dedicated sections.
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		To start please create a new script file following the directions at the top of the page. I am going to call mine knife_reward.gsc.
		Like said, scripting is like math. However, the scripting we are doing is going to be function based.
		
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		Let's look at a math function:
		<pre>f(x) = 2x + 5</pre>
		<br/>
		Now let's turn that into a scripting function:
		
<pre>
f(x)
{
	return 2x+5;
}</pre>

		<br/>
		In mathematical terms, these are the same, only formatted differently.

<pre>
"What is bad syntax?"
	Syntax is the "grammar" of a programming language. It means that there is a typo or something is not formatted correctly.
