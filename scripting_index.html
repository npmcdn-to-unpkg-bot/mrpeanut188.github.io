	<p>Scripting: You've heard of it, and know it has to do with coding. Many people either outsource the scripting to others or learn to complete it themselves.></p>
	
	<p>
		Scripting is a simplified form of coding for inside the game, whether this be Modern Warfare, World at War, or Black Ops. 
		It is what powers all ingame events. Scripting itself is actually a very complicated process with MANY different things to consider,
		however, you have already learned most of these concepts in Math. I'm sure you know that computers work with 1's and 0's, those types of
		coding interact with low-level interfaces where calculations are manually manipulated. The scripting we will be doing is high-level, meaning
		that we will not be dealing with 1's and 0's, far from it, however math is very similar to coding.
