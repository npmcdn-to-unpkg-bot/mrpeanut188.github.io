		<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<pre>
			Hello! My name is Mrpeanut188 and this is my .GSC scripting tutorial for Call of Duty.

			The entire transcript of this video is available in the description or under the embed
			depending on your viewing source.

			Scripting is simply coding for a game level, so in any maps you are creating you can
			create new features or improve existing ones. They are the gears that drive the game.

			Before we get into the actual scripting, there are two prerequisites you need to understand.
			The first is that coding itself is just a method, the skills you need are problem
			solving skills and a basic foundation. Anything you do will have to be specifically
			looked at and there are NO generic answers. If you want to grasp even a basic understanding,
			you will have to do a LOT of reading along with critical thinking.

			The second is the actual filestructure for modding Call of Duty. Inside the RAW folder
			are a bunch of different folders with different types of files. Those are the files
			the game uses, your mod folder contents are packed up and replace these files in the 
			actual game when it is ran. For example, the MAPS folder in your mod directory merges
			and overwrites the MAPS folder loaded by the game when you load your mod. However,
			the RAW files are only for development, the actual game files are packed away.

			Whenever you include something in your mod, it adds those files to the game.
			It also replaces files so you can edit existing files instead of just create.

			NEVER EDIT ANYTHING IN THE RAW FOLDER, INCLUDE IT IN YOUR MOD INSTEAD!

			Now that we have that covered, let's get into the actual scripting.
			For my example to demonstrate some .GSC, I'm going to make a buyable
			that will move to a destination point when purchased.

			Instead of adding this feature to existing scripts, we're going to make it
			as a seperate file. We could then release this to the public or easily add it
			to other projects.

			Script files go inside the MAPS folder. Your thoughts should be "This is a file for
			my mod, so it will go inside my MOD folder."

			As you've noticed inside of the MAPS directory there are many .GSC files, those are
			your scipts.  We're going to create a new .GSC file here, which is a text file.
			For this tutorial I'm calling it 'tutorial.gsc'. 

			Nb. Strongly recommended to have a text editor like Notepad++ or UltraEdit.

			We are now beginning the actual basis to scripting.

			Computers work in numbers, and coding is a lot like math with words.
			The better math knowledge you have the easier this will be to grasp.

			Let's look at a math function: sin(x)

			Sin is the name of the function, x is what is being passed to it (argument).
			Defining functions in scripting is very similar:

			exampleFunction(x, y){}

			The name of it is exampleFunction, and the arguments are x and y. The pair of
			brackets past of it contain all the actions inside of it. To add some actions
			to our function, we need to create a statement. Statments compose the insides
			of functions. Let's make the function add both x and y and give back the value.

			exampleFunction(x, y)
			{
				return x + y;
			}

			Nb. The formatting can be different except for special cases, but this is the recommended formatting.

			This function will now return the added values of x and y. A semicolon is
			required after every statement. To actually use our function, we execute,
			or call the function the same as math.

			exampleFunction(5, 6);

			Nb. Since our function returns a value, we would be using this value directly or setting it to a variable for future use.

			To do anything in the game, many functions have statements which call other functions, and so forth.
			Everything is executed in order from top-to-bottom, so group actions that should happen at the same
			time in the same functions.

			To learn the rest of scripting, please view the individual sections. As of the time of writing,
			none exist but they will shortly. The following is going to explain how to activate your written
			functions so that your code is executed.

			* SHORT PAUSE *

			When you load your map, MAPNAME.gsc is loaded. For all revelant map files, the call should stem
			from this file. If you open the file, you'll see a lot of calls to other files using this format:

			maps\FILENAME::FUNCTION();

			Nb. Filename does not include the .GSC extension.

			To conclude this introduction to the tutorial series, please have a look at the resources page.

			If you have any questions, please leave a comment on this video and I will try to answer all of
			your questions.

			Have a nice day, and journey of learning!
