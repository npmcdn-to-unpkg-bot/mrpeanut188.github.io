		<h4>TRANSCRIPT</h4>
			<p>Hello! My name is Mrpeanut188 and this is my .GSC scripting tutorial for Call of Duty.</p>
			<p>Scripting is simply coding for a game level, so in any maps you are creating you can<br /> create new features or improve existing ones. They are the gears that drive the game.</p>
			<p>Before we get into the actual scripting, there are two prerequisites you need to understand.<br /> The first is that coding itself is just a method, the skills you need are problem<br /> solving skills and a basic foundation. Anything you do will have to be specifically<br /> looked at and there are NO generic answers. If you want to grasp even a basic understanding,<br /> you will have to do a LOT of reading along with critical thinking.</p>
			<p>The second is the actual filestructure for modding Call of Duty. Inside the RAW folder<br /> are a bunch of different folders with different types of files. Those are the files<br /> the game uses, your mod folder contents are packed up and replace these files in the <br /> actual game when it is ran. For example, the MAPS folder in your mod directory merges<br /> and overwrites the MAPS folder loaded by the game when you load your mod. However,<br /> the RAW files are only for development, the actual game files are packed away.</p>
			<p>Whenever you include something in your mod, it adds those files to the game.<br /> It also replaces files so you can edit existing files instead of just create.</p>
			<p>NEVER EDIT ANYTHING IN THE RAW FOLDER, INCLUDE IT IN YOUR MOD INSTEAD!</p>
			<p>Now that we have that covered, let's get into the actual scripting.<br /> For my example to demonstrate some .GSC, I'm going to make a buyable<br /> that will move to a destination point when purchased.</p>
			<p>Instead of adding this feature to existing scripts, we're going to make it<br /> as a seperate file. We could then release this to the public or easily add it<br /> to other projects.</p>
			<p>Script files go inside the MAPS folder. Your thoughts should be "This is a file for<br /> my mod, so it will go inside my MOD folder."</p>
			<p>As you've noticed inside of the MAPS directory there are many .GSC files, those are<br /> your scipts. We're going to create a new .GSC file here, which is a text file.<br /> For this tutorial I'm calling it 'tutorial.gsc'.</p>
			<p>Nb. Strongly recommended to have a text editor like Notepad++ or UltraEdit.</p>
			<p>We are now beginning the actual basis to scripting.</p>
			<p>Computers work in numbers, and coding is a lot like math with words.<br /> The better math knowledge you have the easier this will be to grasp.</p>
			<p>Let's look at a math function: sin(x)</p>
			<p>Sin is the name of the function, x is what is being passed to it (argument).<br /> Defining functions in scripting is very similar:</p>
			<p>exampleFunction(x, y){}</p>
			<p>The name of it is exampleFunction, and the arguments are x and y. The pair of<br /> brackets past of it contain all the actions inside of it. To add some actions<br /> to our function, we need to create a statement. Statments compose the insides<br /> of functions. Let's make the function add both x and y and give back the value.</p>
			<p>exampleFunction(x, y)<br /> {<br /> return x + y;<br /> }</p>
			<p>Nb. The formatting can be different except for special cases, but this is the recommended formatting.</p>
			<p>This function will now return the added values of x and y. A semicolon is<br /> required after every statement. To actually use our function, we execute,<br /> or call the function the same as math.</p>
			<p>exampleFunction(5, 6);</p>
			<p>Nb. Since our function returns a value, we would be using this value directly or setting it to a variable for future use.</p>
			<p>To do anything in the game, many functions have statements which call other functions, and so forth.<br /> Everything is executed in order from top-to-bottom, so group actions that should happen at the same<br /> time in the same functions.</p>
			<p>To learn the rest of scripting, please view the individual sections. As of the time of writing,<br /> none exist but they will shortly. The following is going to explain how to activate your written<br /> functions so that your code is executed.</p>
			<p>When you load your map, MAPNAME.gsc is loaded. For all revelant map files, the call should stem<br /> from this file. If you open the file, you'll see a lot of calls to other files using this format:</p>
			<p>maps\FILENAME::FUNCTION();</p>
			<p>Nb. Filename does not include the .GSC extension.</p>
			<p>To conclude this introduction to the tutorial series, please have a look at the resources page.</p>
			<p>If you have any questions, please leave a comment on this video and I will try to answer all of<br /> your questions.</p>
			<p>Have a nice day, and journey of learning!</p>
